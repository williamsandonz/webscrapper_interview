- Spend only a few hours on this exercise
- List of outputs/tasks that you have not been able to demonstrate in your solution (given the limited time) that you would have done if this had been a project you were asked to complete as part of your job.

Please write some code that scrapes:
    - property name
    - property type (e.g Apartment)
    - number of bedrooms
    - bathrooms
    - list of the amenities for the following 3 properties:

https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/33571268
https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/20669368
https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/50633275

- Some of these URLs may not actually show property details â€“ please handle this case appropriately.

TODO:
    - Where is propertyType?
    - Ensure project is installable
    - Write outputs/tasks if I had more time
